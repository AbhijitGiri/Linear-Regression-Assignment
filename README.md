# Bike Sharing Assignment
The idea of this assignment is to build a Linear regression model and to evaluate the model and also to identify the predominant factors which can drive the demand of shared bikes. <br>

## <ins>General Information</ins>


In this assignment we will be using Linear Regression modelling approach in order to derive a model which can explain the demand of shared bikes. The dataset being used is of a Company known as BoomBikes which is an US based
bike sharing service provider. The provided dataset consists of the total number of count of shared bikes on a given day and also few of the environmental conditions on the particular day.<br>
The main business problem is to explain the business which all factors predominate in explaining the demand of shared bikes. With the obtained analysis and conclusion the Business can optimize its process on suitable days to achieve better profits.<br>
The project will help to use and understand Linear Regression modelling on a real world Business Problem.<br> 
The dataset and the associated data dictioanry is fetched from the link provided by Upgrad in the corresponding assignment section.<br>

## <ins>Conclusions</ins>
1. The year of the rental is also important. In year 2019 the rentals count is higher than previous year.<br>
2. The feeling temperature (atemp) also impacts the bike rentals to greatest extend. Higher the temperature more the rentals thus implying the demand is higher in summer months compared to winter months.<br>
3. On a working day the demand of bike rentals is expected to be higher.<br>
4. Humidity inversely affects the bike rentals. Greater is the humidity , lesser is the demand.<br>
5. On spring season the demand of the rentals is lower compared to other seasons.<br>
6. Windspeed also inversely impacts bike rentals. Greater the windspeed , lesser is the demand.<br>
